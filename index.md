## About Me

I am a final year Computer Science undergrad at IIIT Delhi. I am interested on working on new interesting tech/research projects around AI/ML. 

## Research Interests
My research interests include but are not limited to Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Knowledge Graphs, Agentic AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Deep Learning, Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning.
In Natural Language Processing, I am interested in working around LLM applications, agentic AI, and core LLM optimization problems.
In Reinforcement Learning, I am interested in working in unsupervised reinforcement learning, specifically building agents that can generalize across various tasks in an environment without relying on task tailored reward functions.
I have been working as an Undergraduate Researcher at IIIT Delhi in Flame.nlp Research Lab under Dr. Md. Shad Akhtar since January 2024. Along with this, I have had the opportunity to do Research Internships at AI Institute of University of South Carolina (AIISC) under the guidance of Dr. Amit Sheth and at IIT Patna under the guidance of Dr. Sriparna Saha.
